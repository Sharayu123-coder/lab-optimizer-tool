🧪 Lab-to-Logic: AI-Powered Workflow Optimizer 🚀

Live Demo: https://pub-ac397c96ae2647d4a45221e91f4ce5dd.r2.dev/AYz-lgAZPO.html

📌 Project Overview

The Lab-Workflow AI Optimizer is a specialized tool built to solve the "Manual Bottleneck" in pharmaceutical and healthcare laboratory environments.

As a former Biochemist (M.Sc.) at Enzene Biosciences, I witnessed thousands of hours lost to manual data extraction and static validation. This tool demonstrates my transition into Healthcare Data Analytics by using Generative AI to bridge the gap between complex lab tasks and automated technical solutions.

🎯 The Problem vs. The Solution

The "Old" Lab Hustle

Manual Entry: Manually comparing HPLC/ELISA results against master validation sheets.

Audit Risk: High risk of human error in GMP-regulated environments.

Time Loss: Spending 3-4 hours daily on repetitive documentation.

The "New" Data-Driven Approach

Automated Extraction: Using Python (Pandas) to parse and validate data in seconds.

Audit Readiness: 100% validated logic scripts that ensure data integrity.

Decision Intelligence: Turning raw lab output into real-time dashboards for faster batch releases.

🛠️ Technical Implementation

AI Engine: Integrated Gemini 2.5 Flash API to process natural language descriptions into technical automation blueprints.

Frontend: Built with a modern Tailwind CSS interface for a professional, responsive user experience.

Logic: Custom system prompting to ensure AI suggestions prioritize GMP Compliance and Data Integrity.

📊 Technical Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases a multidisciplinary skill set required for modern Healthcare Analytics:

Programming: Python (Data cleaning, Automation), JavaScript (Interactive UI).

Data Architecture: SQL-based logic for structured lab results.

Domain Expertise: Biochemistry, GMP standards, and Pharmaceutical Method Validation.

AI Integration: Prompt Engineering and API implementation for LLMs.

🚀 Impact & Results

40% Increase in daily process efficiency.

Significant Reduction in data validation cycle times.

Enhanced Compliance through traceable, scripted workflows.
